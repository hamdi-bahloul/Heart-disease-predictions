# Heart-disease-predictions
Creating Machine Learning model to predict whether a patient will has heart disease or not 


After cleaning and visualizing data , I used principal component analysis ( PCA ) for dimensionality reduction . Then I implemented classification machine learning models and by comparing their performances i choose the best one . At the end of the project , A dashboard was created containing data visualization and we can enter patient's informations to get predictions .
