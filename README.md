# Heart-disease-predictions
Creating Machine Learning model to predict whether patients will have heart disease


After cleaning and visualizing data , I used principal component analysis ( PCA ) for dimensionality reduction . Then I implemented classification machine learning models and by comparing their performances i choose the best one . At the end of the project , A dashboard was created containing data visualization and we can enter patient's informations to get predictions .


Data description : 


It's a clean, easy to understand set of data. However, the meaning of some of the column headers are not obvious. Here's what they mean,

age: The person's age in years
sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)
trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)
ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)
thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
